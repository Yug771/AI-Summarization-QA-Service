      "Final Summary: anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status, motor deficits, apathy, and depression [ 13 ] although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients, recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5, 6 ] yet, our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd, as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices, remains meager and lags far behind that of depression. attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test, part b ( tmt - b, z - score ) working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters, z - score ) however the pda+ group had worse verbal performance ( i ) and verbal retention ( p = 0.25 ) compared to the pda group ( p = 0.46, p = 0.43 ) did not differ between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann whitney there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5, p = 0.23 ) participants were split into lpd and rpd, and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda importantly, the groups remained matched in age, disease duration, updrs - iii, dde, h&y stage, and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29, p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda, whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits for example, lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology, whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology thus, cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g, verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however, this remains controversial it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48, 49 ], cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits\n"
