      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky appears blue during the daytime, as the blue light is scattered in all directions and reaches our eyes from all parts of the sky.\n",
